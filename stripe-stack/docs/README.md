## ðŸš€ Stripe Stack Deployment

This is the [Stripe Stack](https://github.com/dev-xo/stripe-stack) Deployment for [Fly.io](https://fly.io)

Select the file that matches your database choice and follow the steps inside it. If at any point you get stuck, you can always reach out the [Fly.io Docs](https://fly.io/docs/), or ask for some help into the [Remix Discord](https://discord.com/invite/xwx7mMzVkA).

> **Note**
> If it's your first time using Fly.io, I'll recommend selecting the `SIMPLE-DATABASE.md` file of your choice.
